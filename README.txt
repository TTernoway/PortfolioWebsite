Portfolio Website.

It's my HTML Landing page but with a portfolio added.

Found a cool way to trick heroku into thinking its a PHP project and hosting static HTML Sites.

Hope you enjoy!

(PHP is technically a framework according to heroku so I better get marks for that ;) https://imgur.com/a/MTKHqPE )
